## 🎯 Immediate Priorities

### For Today's Editorial Sprint:
1. **Use "Senses Write the Score" framework** as discussion catalyst
2. **Reference touch vocabulary hierarchy** for somatic discussions
3. **Apply Bessel bridging strategies** from playbook
4. **Focus on flow over features** per Licia's priority

### When Materials Arrive:
1. **First:** Process one Perplexity thread as test
2. **Second:** Batch process remaining threads
3. **Third:** Extract questions and create clusters
4. **Fourth:** Generate flow maps for chapters

## 🏗️ System Architecture Updates Needed

### Based on Transcript Analysis:

1. **Add 14th Agent: Psychedelic Integration Specialist**
   - Focus on integration methodologies
   - Privacy-first case study processing
   - Bridge somatic and psychedelic worlds

2. **Enhance Touch Flow Taxonomy Agent**
   - Expand vocabulary per Licia's hierarchy
   - Include all contact modalities
   - Map to clinical applications

3. **Create Multi-Directional Research Discovery**
   - Not just retroactive validation
   - Open-ended pattern matching
   - Bidirectional: Practice ↔ Science

4. **Implement "Senses Write Score" Evaluation**
   - All agents look for sensory sovereignty evidence
   - Track agency emergence patterns
   - Connect all findings to central metaphor
