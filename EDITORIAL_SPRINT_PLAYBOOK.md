# Editorial Sprint Playbook
## Materials & Strategy for 3-Day Intensive with Bessel & Editors

### 🎯 Sprint Goals (From Licia)
1. **Solid outline** that Bessel, Licia, and editors all "feel good about"
2. **Content in order** with clear narrative flow
3. **Identify holes** and gaps in coverage
4. **Find authentic voice** - "how to put it more into our own words"
5. **Case study placement** - where examples fit

### 🎭 The Editorial Team Dynamic
- **Editors are "hot dogs"** - improvisational, energetic
- **They'll "jump in"** with sticky pads and giant whiteboard
- **Bessel has "old school" writing approach** - may need gentle bridging
- **Licia thinks in flow**, Bessel thinks in details

## 📦 Immediate Deliverables ("Nutrients and Tee-ups")

### 1. 🌊 Question Flow Map
**Format:** Modular cards that can be rearranged

#### Card Structure:
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ THEME: [Theme Name]     │
│                         │
│ Questions:              │
│ • [Question 1]          │
│ • [Question 2]          │
│                         │
│ Overlaps with:          │
│ [Other themes]          │
│                         │
│ Chapter Candidate: #    │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

#### Flow Visualization:
- Start with broad questions → narrow to specific
- Show connections between themes with lines
- Mark which questions appear in multiple threads
- Create natural chapter sequences

### 2. 🎵 "Senses Write the Score" Master Board

#### Central Concept Map:
```
                    SENSES WRITE THE SCORE
                            │
        ┌───────────────────┼───────────────────┐
        │                   │                   │
   Physical Senses    Metaphorical Senses    Agency
        │                   │                   │
   • Touch            • Sense of Self      • Trust
   • Sound            • Sense of Time      • Choice
   • Sight            • Sense of Safety    • Action
   • Etc.             • Sense of Justice   • Sovereignty
```

#### Discussion Prompts:
- Is this THE overarching framework?
- How does each chapter serve this metaphor?
- Where's the research support?
- What case studies illustrate this?

### 3. 👋 Touch Vocabulary Taxonomy

#### Hierarchy of Contact (Visual):
```
PROXIMITY ──► EYE CONTACT ──► VOICE ──► ENERGY ──► PHYSICAL TOUCH
    │             │            │         │            │
"Being near"  "Visual touch" "Sonic"  "Field"   "Direct contact"
                                                      │
                                         ┌────────────┼────────────┐
                                    Self-touch  Supported  Partnered
```

#### Clinical Applications:
- **For therapists without touch permission**
- **For touch-phobic clients**
- **Cultural variations**
- **Safety protocols**

### 4. 🍄 Psychedelic Integration Priority Board

#### Why This Matters:
- Bessel has psychedelics chapter
- Licia is THE integration expert
- "Many people have had terrible integrations"

#### Key Points for Discussion:
- Integration as somatic process
- Where embodiment meets expansion
- Case studies (with privacy protection)
- Australia Mind Medicine insights

### 5. 🔬 Science-Practice Bridge Cards

#### Format: Two-sided cards
**Front:** Licia's somatic exploration
**Back:** Supporting science

Example:
```
FRONT:                          BACK:
"Sensing the depth of          Studies show interoceptive
your body from surface         awareness activates insula,
to spine"                      improves emotional regulation
                              (Craig, 2009; Farb et al., 2015)
```

### 6. 📊 Perplexity Source Quality Dashboard

#### Visual Breakdown:
```
Thread Quality Overview
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⭐ Gold (Academic):    25%
✓ Reliable (Pro):     35%
⚠️ Caution (General):  40%

Strongest Evidence:
• [Topic] - 8 gold sources
• [Topic] - 6 gold sources

Needs Better Support:
• [Topic] - only general sources
```

## 🎯 Bridging Bessel & Licia

### Starting Points from Bessel's World:
1. **Rubber hand experiment** → Explore trust vs. tricks
2. **Neuroscience findings** → Connect to embodied experience
3. **Clinical studies** → Show somatic correlates
4. **His existing framework** → Expand with sensory sovereignty

### Translation Strategies:
- Never say "this proves" - say "we noticed"
- Start with his concepts, gently expand
- Use convergent evidence from multiple perspectives
- Frame as collaborative discovery

### Example Bridge:
"Bessel, your work on the freeze response is fascinating. We're seeing participants naturally move through that sequence, but with this breath work addition, they seem to complete the cycle more fully. What do you make of this pattern?"

## 💡 Remember

### Licia's Wisdom:
> "I'm thinking about the flow of things... Bessel is mired in details."

### Brett's Observation:
> "The senses write the score - that's got to be on the cover!"

### The Mission:
Not to convince but to reveal. Not to impose but to discover. Not to separate but to bridge.
