## üìå Critical Information for Next Context

### System Philosophy
- **"Revelation, not persuasion"** - Let rigor emerge naturally
- **Dual-layer preservation** - Keep nuance AND add intelligence
- **Progressive complexity** - Start simple, enhance gradually
- **Assume breach security** - Continue operating when compromised

### Key Relationships
- **Licia Sky** - 40 years of trauma healing wisdom
- **Bessel van der Kolk** - Co-author, needs to see Licia's rigor naturally
- **Editorial Team** - 3-day sprint happening NOW
- **Book Project** - Sequel to "The Body Keeps the Score"

### Technical Stack
- **13 Agents** (5 Nuance + 8 Intelligence)
- **Docker** for containerization
- **ChromaDB** for vector storage
- **Redis** for caching
- **MCP Servers** for enhanced capabilities
- **Claude Code** for agent implementation

### File References
- **Original Requirements:** User refinement prompts in this plan
- **Design Decisions:** SEQUENTIAL_THINKING_LOG.md
- **Gap Analysis:** GAP_ANALYSIS.md
- **Core Architecture:** PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION_V2.md
- **Workflows:** WORKFLOWS.md (needs updates)

## üéØ Next Immediate Actions

When this context loads, immediately:

1. **Check Implementation Status** above
2. **Continue with uncompleted üîÑ items**
3. **Prioritize Editorial Sprint needs**
4. **Create missing specification files**
5. **Update existing files with gaps**

### Sample Next Commands:
```bash
# Update workflows with Priority 1 items
<read_file path="WORKFLOWS.md">
<replace_in_file ...> # Add Perplexity ranking workflow

# Create new specification
<write_to_file path="PERPLEXITY_RANKING_SPEC.md">

# Create playbook
<write_to_file path="EDITORIAL_SPRINT_PLAYBOOK.md">
```

## üîê Context Preservation

This file should be read FIRST in any new context window. It contains:
- Complete implementation roadmap
- All 14 gaps with solutions
- Priority ordering and dependencies
- Technical specifications
- Philosophy and relationships
- Next action commands

**Remember:** The editorial sprint is TIME-CRITICAL. Bessel and the team need materials that naturally reveal Licia's rigor without forcing it. Every implementation decision should support this delicate balance.
