# Licia's Research Lab V2
## A Computational Platform for Somatic Trauma Healing Research

This repository contains a multi-agent analysis system designed to process, validate, and synthesize four decades of somatic trauma healing practice. The system employs 19 specialized computational agents that examine therapeutic transcripts, research documents, and clinical observations through distinct analytical lenses.

---

## Research Context

Licia Sky has developed somatic trauma healing methodologies over 40 years of clinical practice. This computational system was built to:

1. Analyze therapeutic session transcripts with forensic accuracy
2. Identify patterns across thousands of clinical interactions
3. Bridge somatic practice with neuroscience research
4. Generate evidence-based documentation for academic publication

The system processes content through multiple analytical perspectives simultaneously, similar to having a research team where each member specializes in a different aspect of trauma healing - from attachment dynamics to neurobiological responses, from cultural context to somatic awareness.

## System Architecture

### 19 Specialized Analysis Agents

The system employs 19 distinct computational agents, each implementing specific analytical frameworks:

#### Forensic Foundation (2 agents)
- **Forensic Accuracy**: Character-level transcript validation
- **Verbatim Preservation**: Maintains exact therapeutic language

#### Core Analysis (11 agents)
- **Emotional Intelligence**: Maps emotional progression patterns
- **Somatic Awareness**: Tracks body-emotion correlations
- **Therapeutic Alliance**: Analyzes trust dynamics
- **Attachment Dynamics**: Identifies attachment patterns
- **Safety & Trust**: Monitors safety markers
- **Unconscious Communication**: Detects non-verbal patterns
- **Cultural Context**: Applies cultural competency frameworks
- **Clinical Terminology**: Maintains dual vocabularies (clinical/accessible)
- **Narrative Coherence**: Evaluates story structure
- **Research Connector**: Links to existing literature
- **Gaps Identifier**: Finds unexplored areas

#### Validation Layer (5 agents)
- **Academic Rigor**: Ensures scholarly standards
- **Scientific Validation**: Connects practice to research
- **Action Research Validator**: Applies participatory research methods
- **Semantic Weaponization Detector**: Identifies potential misuse
- **Trauma Pattern Validator**: Verifies therapeutic approaches

#### Synthesis (1 agent)
- **Integration Synthesis**: Combines all analytical outputs

### Dual Orchestration Architecture

The system operates through two parallel orchestration pathways that provide redundancy and distributed processing:

1. **VS Code Extension Orchestrator**: Manages sequential deep analysis
2. **CLI Orchestrator**: Handles parallel batch processing

These orchestrators coordinate through Redis, enabling:
- Automatic failover if one pathway fails
- Distributed processing across multiple documents
- Real-time synchronization of findings
- Preservation of analytical context

### Quality Assessment Framework

Every output is evaluated using the TDAI (Therapeutic Depth Assessment Index), which measures:

- **Qualitative Rigor** (0-10): Phenomenological depth, narrative coherence, contextual richness
- **Quantitative Rigor** (0-10): Statistical patterns, correlation strength, reproducibility
- **Cross-Validation**: Thermopylae consensus between multiple agent perspectives

Minimum thresholds:
- Research documentation: 8.0
- Publication ready: 9.0
- Breakthrough indicator: 9.5

## Research Methodologies

### Multi-Perspective Analysis

Each therapeutic transcript undergoes analysis from 19 distinct perspectives simultaneously. This approach mirrors interdisciplinary research teams where neurobiologists, attachment theorists, cultural anthropologists, and somatic practitioners would each contribute their expertise.

### Semantic Synchronization

Agents maintain vocabulary coherence through a shared semantic layer, preventing the fragmentation that often occurs in interdisciplinary research. Terms like "activation," "resourcing," and "titration" maintain consistent meaning across all analytical perspectives.

### Evidence Triangulation

The system employs three-way validation:
1. **Practice-Based Evidence**: Patterns from clinical sessions
2. **Research Literature**: Connections to published studies
3. **Cross-Cultural Validation**: Indigenous and non-Western healing practices

---

## Document Processing Pipeline

### Input Processing
- **Word Documents**: Extracts questions, themes, and insights from 30+ documents
- **Perplexity Research Threads**: Analyzes and ranks sources by academic quality
  - Tier 1: Peer-reviewed academic sources
  - Tier 2: Professional and institutional sources
  - Tier 3: General references

### Output Generation
The system produces six core research outputs:

1. **Question Flow Map**: Clustered inquiries revealing chapter organization
2. **"Senses Write the Score" Framework**: Central theoretical contribution
3. **Touch Vocabulary Taxonomy**: Seven-level hierarchy of therapeutic contact
4. **Psychedelic Integration Protocols**: Somatic approaches to integration
5. **Science-Practice Bridge Cards**: Two-sided validation connecting practice to research
6. **Source Quality Dashboard**: Research foundation assessment

## Technical Implementation

### Installation

```bash
# Start Redis for orchestrator coordination
docker run -d --name redis-lab -p 6379:6379 redis:7-alpine

# Process research documents
python ingestion/word_processor.py /path/to/documents/*.docx
python ingestion/perplexity_analyzer.py /path/to/research/*.html

# Generate editorial outputs
python editorial_generator.py
```

### Orchestrator Initialization

1. **VS Code Extension**: Load `CLAUDE_VSCODE_INSTRUCTIONS.md` into Claude within VS Code
2. **CLI Orchestrator**: Load `CLAUDE_CLI_INSTRUCTIONS.md` into Claude CLI
3. Both orchestrators will automatically discover each other through Redis and coordinate processing

### Security Measures

- Input sanitization prevents prompt injection
- Docker containerization isolates agent processes
- Audit logging tracks all analytical decisions
- Unicode normalization blocks character-based attacks

## For AI Practitioners: Technical Depth

### Agent Coordination Patterns

The system implements several sophisticated multi-agent patterns:

#### Wave Processing
Agents execute in four sequential waves, with each wave's outputs informing the next:
1. Forensic validation establishes ground truth
2. Core analysis applies theoretical frameworks
3. Validation ensures rigor
4. Synthesis integrates findings

#### Semantic Covenant
Agents share a vocabulary synchronization layer preventing the compartmentalization common in parallel processing. This maintains conceptual coherence while enabling distributed computation.

#### Failover Architecture
The dual orchestrator pattern provides resilience through:
- Heartbeat monitoring (30-second TTL)
- Automatic task redistribution on failure
- State preservation in Redis
- Atomic task claiming via BRPOPLPUSH operations

#### Vector Memory Architecture
- **Immediate**: Agent context windows (200K tokens)
- **Short-term**: Redis cache (24-hour TTL)
- **Long-term**: ChromaDB vector embeddings
- **Cross-reference**: Semantic similarity search across all memory layers

### Performance Characteristics
- Throughput: >1 transcript per minute with full 19-agent analysis
- Parallel document processing: 3 concurrent workers per orchestrator
- Failover recovery: <60 seconds
- Context preservation: Infinite through vector database

## Academic Context

This computational approach to somatic trauma research addresses several methodological challenges:

1. **Scale**: Analyzing thousands of hours of therapeutic sessions manually would require years
2. **Consistency**: Multiple analytical perspectives applied uniformly across all content
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying subtle patterns invisible to sequential analysis
4. **Cross-Validation**: Every finding verified through multiple theoretical lenses
5. **Reproducibility**: Analytical process fully documented and repeatable

The system does not replace clinical judgment or therapeutic intuition. Instead, it reveals patterns and connections that support evidence-based practice while preserving the nuanced, embodied wisdom of somatic healing work.
