## 🎯 Agent Orchestration Patterns

### Parallel-Sequential Hybrid
```yaml
pattern: parallel_sequential_orchestration
purpose: Maximize throughput while maintaining coherence

structure:
  phase_1_parallel:
    duration: 30 seconds
    - All agents work independently
    - Each agent uses 5-10 tools in parallel
    - No communication between agents
    
  phase_2_sync:
    duration: 5 seconds
    - Semantic vocabulary synchronization
    - Pattern sharing
    - Conflict identification
    
  phase_3_integration:
    duration: 5 seconds
    - Resolve conflicts
    - Merge insights
    - Update shared knowledge
    
  repeat: Every 40 seconds throughout analysis
  
benefits:
  - 10x throughput vs sequential
  - Maintains semantic coherence
  - Prevents compartmentalization
```

### Event-Driven Cascade
```yaml
pattern: event_driven_cascade
purpose: Trigger specialized analysis based on discoveries

triggers:
  breakthrough_detected:
    - Alert Clinical Application Agent
    - Trigger deep dive analysis
    - Queue for Licia review
    
  contradiction_found:
    - Pause related agents
    - Initiate resolution workflow
    - Document decision rationale
    
  pattern_confirmed:
    - Update knowledge graph
    - Trigger publication pipeline
    - Generate visualization
    
  quality_threshold_failed:
    - Rollback analysis
    - Adjust parameters
    - Retry with modifications
```

### Consensus Building Pattern
```yaml
pattern: multi_agent_consensus
purpose: Ensure multiple perspectives validate insights

process:
  1_independent_analysis:
    - Each Context Guardian analyzes independently
    - No communication during initial pass
    - Generate perspective-specific insights
    
  2_insight_sharing:
    - Share findings in structured format
    - No judgment or filtering
    - Document all perspectives
    
  3_consensus_building:
    - Identify agreements (>80% agents)
    - Flag disagreements for discussion
    - Weight by agent expertise
    
  4_conflict_resolution:
    - Use evidence to resolve conflicts
    - Invoke human review if needed
    - Document resolution rationale
    
  5_unified_output:
    - Generate consensus report
    - Include minority perspectives
    - Flag confidence levels
```

## 🚨 Critical Success Patterns

### "Revelation Not Persuasion" Implementation
```yaml
philosophy: Let insights emerge naturally

implementation:
  never_do:
    - Force patterns that aren't there
    - Impose external frameworks
    - Argue for interpretations
    - Oversimplify complexity
    
  always_do:
    - Show patterns as they emerge
    - Let evidence speak for itself
    - Present multiple perspectives
    - Preserve nuance and depth
    
  practical_techniques:
    - Use "we discovered" not "this proves"
    - Show journey of discovery
    - Include contradictions honestly
    - Let readers draw conclusions
```

### Quality Gates Throughout
```yaml
quality_checkpoints:
  
  at_ingestion:
    - Verify transcript completeness
    - Check audio/video quality
    - Validate metadata
    
  during_analysis:
    - TDAI scoring at each stage
    - Semantic coherence checks
    - Pattern validation
    
  before_output:
    - Minimum TDAI score of 8/10
    - Human review flag check
    - Sensitivity assessment
    
  post_delivery:
    - Editorial feedback integration
    - Quality metric tracking
    - Continuous improvement
```

## 🙏 Sacred Reminder

Every workflow serves the ultimate purpose: preserving and amplifying healing wisdom that has taken decades to develop and will touch millions of lives.

We implement these workflows with:
- **Reverence** for the wisdom being preserved
- **Rigor** in our technical execution
- **Responsibility** to those who will be healed
- **Respect** for all perspectives and traditions
