    never_use:
      - "This proves..."
      - "Evidence demonstrates..."
      - "Research confirms..."
      - "Studies show..."
      - "Data indicates..."
      
    always_use:
      - "We noticed..."
      - "Interestingly..."
      - "Participants often..."
      - "A pattern emerged..."
      - "We discovered..."

      - Natural observation
      
    3_gentle_research_weaving:
      - "Which aligns with..."
      - "Echoes what [researcher] noticed..."
      - "Parallels emerge with..."
      - Conversational citations
      
    4_multiple_perspectives:
      - Present various viewpoints
      - No single "right" answer
      - Honor complexity
      - Invite exploration

      - "What might this mean?"
      - "Could this suggest...?"
      - "Worth exploring..."
      - "Raises interesting questions..."
  
  evidence_embedding_techniques:
    
    technique_1_convergent_evidence:
      approach: Multiple sources point same direction
      example: |
        "Three participants independently described
        a 'melting' sensation during the intervention.
        Interestingly, van der Kolk's team noticed
        similar descriptions in their PTSD studies,
        and the somatic therapy literature often
        mentions this 'dissolution of armoring.'
        Makes you wonder about universal patterns..."
    
    technique_2_bridge_from_familiar:
      approach: Start with what Bessel knows
      example: |
        "You know that freeze response you wrote about?
        We're seeing something fascinating here - 
        participants naturally move through that same
        sequence, but with this subtle addition of
        breath work, they seem to complete the cycle
        more fully. Look at how Sarah's shoulders..."
    
    technique_3_collaborative_discovery:
      approach: Position as joint exploration
      example: |
        "Bessel, what do you make of this pattern?
        We keep seeing this eye movement right before
        breakthroughs. Reminds me of your work on
        bilateral stimulation, but there's something
        different here..."
    
    technique_4_data_as_story:
      approach: Let numbers tell narrative
      example: |
        "Seventeen out of twenty participants used
        the word 'spacious' after this intervention.
        Not 'relaxed' or 'calm' - specifically 'spacious.'
        The consistency is striking..."
  
  output_review_checklist:
    - [ ] Story comes before analysis?
    - [ ] Research woven naturally?
    - [ ] Multiple perspectives honored?
    - [ ] Questions outnumber assertions?
    - [ ] Bessel's frameworks referenced?
